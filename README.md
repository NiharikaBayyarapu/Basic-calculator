In this project I created a basic calculator using Html,CSS and JavaScript.The calculator is made in such a way that a functiional calculator can perform arithmetic operation,such a addition,subtraction,multiplication and division.By completing this project my front-end development skills are developed and enhanced my understanding of web technologies.
